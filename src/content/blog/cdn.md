# Relocation of scripts

Some days ago, I tested my tools website on my school network. Sadly, I found out that in some cases, the script loading mechanism was blocked. It was only in Firefox, but only on my schools network. All versions of all my websites were developed using Brave and Firefox (Zen Browser). I don't know what caused this, but it could be a setting that was set by the city for all schools. I don't know if this is the case, but I wanted to make sure that my website is accessible for all users.
I decided to host all scripts on my own server instead of using jsdelivr. This should help with some school firewalls that block jsdelivr. Also, I noticed that loading times are a bit faster when using my own server.

# Finally released ðŸŽ‰

I started this tool for some CTFs, and to learn different techniques for programming. Also, this tool is a little bit inspired by CyberChef. I didn't use any code from them but wanted some similar functions.

Also, I created this page to revive [mdhtml](https://github.com/Minecodes/mdhtml)
